# resumeProjects
 Hello! My name is Spencer. This repository contains projects mentioned in my resume. 

## Projects
 labMonitorTool is a .NET 5.0 project, made in a group with two other people, which can be run right from Visual Studio. Our Figma prototype can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/TBF8L7XzEdqCJu5JY2d65k/AS-Capstone-Project?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=RnKWyS5e9tOg9zjI-1) - I assisted in its initial creation and later revision, and it was almost exclusively me who integrated interactivity into the Figma prototype.
 labMonitorTool is the Associate's Capstone Project, a previous iteration of LabPortal, which is still in progress and as such not posted here.
 
 monsterHunterApp is a React Native app, written and tested by myself using Expo.
 
 Lastly, I have decided to upload both my [technical document about the Nintendo Wii](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PIcb0AxR7fnzMw7Ar1xthuwpVYzClyZ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117746708171949207126&rtpof=true&sd=true) and my [research paper surrounding the Police](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IefA46PaiU19RH2fKhNhytVEomkpZJia/view?usp=sharing) to Google Docs.

## Thank you!
