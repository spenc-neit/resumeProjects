# resumeProjects
 Hello! My name is Spencer. This repository contains the two projects mentioned in my resume. 

## Projects
 labMonitorTool is a .NET 5.0 project, made in a group with two other people, which can be run right from Visual Studio. Our Figma prototype can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/TBF8L7XzEdqCJu5JY2d65k/AS-Capstone-Project?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=RnKWyS5e9tOg9zjI-1) - I assisted in its initial creation and later revision, and it was almost exclusively me who integrated interactivity into the Figma prototype.
 
 monsterHunterApp is a React Native app, written and tested by myself using Expo.
 
 Lastly, I have decided to upload my technical document about the Nintendo Wii to Google Docs. [Here is the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PIcb0AxR7fnzMw7Ar1xthuwpVYzClyZ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117746708171949207126&rtpof=true&sd=true).
 The document was written in Microsoft Word, so it is in Word that its original design and formatting will be shown the clearest.

## Thank you!
 If you have any questions about these projects, please don't hesitate to reach out.
